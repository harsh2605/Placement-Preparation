-> To set the value of any attribute as primary key (
example:create table emloyee(
employee_id number,
primary key(employee_id));

->And if want to set the foreign key than the syntax will be 
example: create table department(
foreign key(department_id) references employee(employee_id));

-> create table department_info as select * from department where 1=0;//This 1=0 will always return a false value 
so no rows will be added to the department_info table only the structure will be added;

->Want to rename the name of the column:
Syntax: alter table employee rename column contact_no to phone_no;

->Want to modify the data type of any particular attriubute
syntax : alter table employee modify employee_id number(10);

->Want to add referential integrity constraint to any of the column
syntax : alter table courier add constraint fk6(yaha par kuch v name ho sakta hai) foreign key(branch_id) references branch(branch_id);

->Want to add NOT NULL to any predefined data type column
alter table courier modify branch_id number(10) NOT NULL;

alter table employee
add branch_name varchar2(25) NOT NULL;
alter table employee

->Want to drop a table using cascading constraint(cascading constraint kya karta hai ki referential integrity hai jo agar do tables connected hai suppose ek hai order having the primary key and other is order_item having the foreign key
agar order deleted hota hai to with the use of cascading constraint the order_items which are releated to the order will also be deleted

Syntax: drop table courier cascade contraint;
